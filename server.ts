const DEFAULT_NDA_CONTENT = `MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into as of May 28, 2026, by and between CookieCare Corp, and the receiving business partner.

The parties wish to explore a business opportunity of mutual interest and in connection therewith, may disclose to each other certain confidential technical and business information.

2. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
"Confidential Information" means any information disclosed by either party (the "Disclosing Party") to the other party (the "Receiving Party") that is marked as confidential or would logically be understood to be confidential under the circumstances.

*CRITICAL CLAUSE EXCEPTION*
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Disclosing Party shall have the unconditional right to audit Receiving Party's servers at any time without prior written notice (HIGH RISK EXCEPTION).

By no means shall either party disclose the Confidential Information to any third party for a duration of ten (10) years following termination of this Agreement (MEDIUM RISK CLAUSE).

3. EXCLUSIONS
Confidential Information does not include information that is:
(a) in the public domain at the time of disclosure;
(b) known to Receiving Party prior to receipt;
(c) independently developed by Receiving Party without breach.

4. REMEDIES
In the event of a breach, Disclosing Party is entitled to immediate injunctive relief and liquidated damages of a minimum of USD $5,000,000 without needing to prove actual damages (HIGH RISK REMEDY).

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement.

CookieCare Corporation:
Signer name: ___________________

const DEFAULT_DPA_CONTENT = `DATA PROCESSING AGREEMENT (DPA)

This Data Processing Agreement ("DPA") governs the processing of personal data in connection with the Master Services Agreement between CookieCare Corp and customer.

1. DEFINITIONS
"GDPR" means the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679).
"Personal Data", "Controller", "Processor", and "Processing" have the meanings given in the GDPR.

2. PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
Processor shall only process Personal Data on instructions from Controller. If Processor is required by law to process Personal Data otherwise, it shall prompt Controller unless prohibited by law.

*NON-COMPLIANCE EXCEPTION*
The Processor reserves the right to share generic user logs and telemetry metadata with external advertisers with implied consent (HIGH SEVERITY PRIVACY GAP).

Subprocessors may be engaged without prior notice to the Controller, and the Processor shall maintain an updated list on its public website (MEDIUM RISK SUBPROCESSOR GAP).

3. SECURITY MEASURES
Processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized access, destruction, or disclosure. Processor guarantees an SLA uptime of 99.0% for cloud sync nodes.

4. AUDITS AND LIABILITY
Any data privacy audit requested by Controller shall be performed at Controller's sole expense, and Controller may only request audits once every five (5) years (HIGH RISK AUDIT BARRIER).`;
